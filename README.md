## üìÑ Smart Contract Architecture

### Main Module: `crop_nft.move`

#### Core Structs
- **`CropReceipt`**: Stores crop details, quality, storage info
- **`LoanRecord`**: Tracks loan principal, interest, due dates
- **`CollectionData`**: NFT collection metadata

#### Key Functions
- **`mint_crop_receipt()`**: Creates new NFT for crop storage receipt
- **`create_loan()`**: Locks NFT and issues loan
- **`repay_loan()`**: Processes repayment and unlocks NFT
- **View functions**: Query receipt details, loan status, repayment amounts

#### Events
- `ReceiptMinted`: Emitted when new crop receipt NFT is created
- `LoanCreated`: Emitted when loan is issued against NFT
- `LoanRepaid`: Emitted when loan is successfully repaid

## üîê Security Features

- **Ownership Verification**: Only NFT owner can use it as collateral
- **Lock Mechanism**: Prevents double-spending of collateral
- **Interest Calculation**: Time-based interest accrual
- **Repayment Validation**: Ensures sufficient payment before unlock
